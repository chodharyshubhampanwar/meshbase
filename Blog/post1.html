              <p>Research shows that when employees leave places with a high concentration of specialized workers, innovation is stifled.
                And as the pandemic continues, more companies are letting workers
                move far away from the office, sometimes permanently. So why is proximity important, and what are companies doing to adapt to their decentralized workforces?</p>
                
                <p>Over the decades, tech companies like Apple, Tesla and Facebook
opened offices in Silicon Valley, creating a hub of specialized tech workers. Business leaders and economists say that this proximity
is key to the success of a new venture. Research from the labour economist, Enrico Moretti suggests that when specialized workers
live near one another, their companies gain a competitive advantage.</p>

<br>

<p>In a recent paper, Moretti traced the migration patterns in patent filings of more than 900,000 scientists, inventors and engineers. He found that when a worker leaves an industry specialized city, that worker innovates at a slower pace.</p>


<p>Moretti says that on average, a worker in a city with many companies in their field will produce better ideas at a faster pace. But during the pandemic, people have left tech clusters like San Francisco, some permanently. Companies say that some employees want to be closer to their home towns and families, others are looking to save money.
Though the median price for a one-bedroom rental fell in 2020,
San Francisco remains one of the most expensive metro areas
in the US. Over recent years, that led to a migration from the Bay
to places like Sacramento, Las Vegas and Austin, Texas. Companies have had to re-imagine how they'll keep innovating while their workforces spread out.</p>

<p>For a decade, Laszlo Bock led people operations at Google. In 2017 he launched his own company, Hulu. Hulu develops products that influence worker behaviour. It's headquartered near Alphabet's campus in Mountain View. Bock says that these moments of serendipity are the building blocks of innovation, but they come most easily in person. Bock says that innovation in the workplace comes from low-affinity distance.

Some companies prefer to develop those bonds in person and others are leaning into the remote experience. In the short term, companies are turning to their own products to build community. Facebook, for example, is adding workplace friendly features to its portal video conferencing product.

Humu's nudge product sends messages to employees at specific times to encourage behaviours that boost productivity. For example, it might send a nudge that suggests changing up weekly virtual team bonding activities.

Other companies are cutting down on avoidable meetings and designing workflows that accommodate people who live in different time zones.</p>
<br>

<p>An example of this might be having a really, really clear problem statement in a Google document and a proposed solution to that, and having multiple people being able to weigh in on that document, giving comments on their own time, and then that being sufficient enough for the project leader to synthesize all that
information and make the next iteration of that proposed solution.</p>
<br>

<p>Dominique Baillet shapes the employee experience at Coinbase,
a San Francisco tech company that is now remote first. She says, it's an opportunity to make the workplace more efficient for people who may have otherwise been marginalized.</p>
<br>
<p>At other companies like Facebook, corporate offsite gatherings could invert into onsite for remote workers at headquarters, but Alphabet, for example, plans to have workers return to the office when it's safe.
Surveys conducted by economists say that after the pandemic,
about 25% of all full workdays will be performed from home. In the meantime, companies will keep revamping the remote experience.</p>
