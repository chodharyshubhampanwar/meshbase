        <br>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>With the recent economic slowdown, mass layoffs, and dip in tech stocks, the VC money have dried up for the majority of the startups and aspiring founders, they have been struggling to raise capital and it has become even more difficult for them startups with high burn rate.
        <p>
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>VC funding is still the most popular way of raising capital but it is not accessible to all.</li>
          <li>VC-backed startups are generally high-risk, high-return affairs that are not suitable for the majority of the founders.</li>
          <li>Many startups raise more funds with assumptions and anticipation without a proper revenue model resulting in higher cash burn.</li>
          <li>Raising capital from banks and institutions is a painful, long, and expensive process without a guaranteed outcome.</li>
          <li>The pandemic forced many startups and businesses to shut down due to a lack of funds and the absence of alternative options.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>

        <h3>Trends </h3>
        A breed of new startups is offering an alternative to private equity and early-stage venture investments or debt, allowing startups and SMEs to get financing without giving up equity or the burden of inflexible debt conditions.
      </p>

        <div style="width:100%">
        <h3 style="text-align:center">Moving forward </h3>
        <ul>
      <li>Revenue Based Funding offers lower risk by investing in startups post-revenue. They offer an option to non-unicorns.</li>
      <li>Revenue-based financing offers quick capital and collateral-free funding unlike banks and other institutions.</li>
      <li>Revenue-based financing gives full control of ownership and decision-making entirely to the founder.</li>
      <li>The money is repaid as a percentage of future revenues, which means that if sales struggle, the company will have more time to pay, otherwise it will repay the debt quickly.</li>
      <li>The borrower is typically required to have repeatable sales and a track record that demonstrates a strong revenue stream, and therefore a clear ability to return the capital to the investors.
      </li>

        <ol>
          <li>The revenue-based financing opportunity in India is estimated around $5-8 billion, with a potential to reach $40-50 billion over the next few years, according to experts.

      </p>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>

  
          <P>
            <ul>
              <li>Revenue-based financing is not an option for the borrowers who are new to the financial ecosystem or have no borrowing history.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              Revenue-based financing offers limited capital and funding options, which are barrier scalability, experiment, and rapid expansion.</li>
              <li>Just like VC and private equity revenue-based financing is accessible to very limited borrowers and businesses with high growth and revenue model.</li>
            </P>
