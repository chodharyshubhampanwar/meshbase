        <p>Environmental, social and corporate governance. Or E.S.G. These are the trendiest words in finance.
          Supporters say that being ethical and being profitable need not be mutually exclusive, benefitting
          stakeholders, society and the planet. But critics argue that these products are not that different from other
          investments, and complain that it can be hard to measure whether a company is actually doing the right thing.
          So, is ESG just good branding?
        </p>



        <p>The idea of investing based on a set of principles, and not merely for profits, is as old as the concept of
          investing itself. In the 18th Century, Christian groups such as the Methodists and Quakers articulated this
          idea with clear guidelines to their followers, and it has been gaining ground ever since. The pressure to
          avoid giving capital to South African companies between the 1970s and 1990s is seen as a factor that
          contributed to the end of apartheid.</p>

        <p>More recently, the impact of our day-to-day lives on the environment has been the center of attention. And
          that is affecting how investors allocate their money.This awareness has led fund managers to create financial
          products which invest in companies that meet their criteria of being ESG-friendly.And more investors are
          adding ESG funds to their portfolios.The share of global investors that applied ESG criteria to at least a
          quarter of their total investments jumped from 48% in 2017 to 75% in 2019. In the U.S., professional investors
          are expected to expand their holdings of ESG assets from $12 trillion in 2018 to $35 trillion by 2025, or 50%
          of their total investments. These numbers were calculated before the coronavirus pandemic, but the health
          emergency could further accelerate this trend.So, how does an ESG fund actually work?</p>

      

        <p>The principles of ESG are really an underpinning for how stocks are selected. Looking at ‘G’, the governance,
          of how the management of those companies works. Looking at the ’S’ has become incredibly important during the
          pandemic, thinking about how the company is interacting with all its stakeholders, including the communities
          it operates in and its employees. And then the environment and environmental policies and actions by
          companies. So really, it’s become a much more thorough and integrated part of the evaluation of companies that
          get put into portfolios that become ESG funds.</p>

        <p>The investment profiles of the world’s four biggest ESG funds have changed over time. For instance, about a
          decade ago, they included substantial stakes in major oil firms. In 2007, the largest ESG fund had almost 13%
          of its total investments in companies such as Royal Dutch Shell, Total and ExxonMobil. But this has fallen in
          the years since, and the share of oil companies featured in this particular ESG fund’s holdings has shrunk to
          less than 3% as of July 2020. But how can funds that claim to promote sustainability ever support oil firms,
          which are widely seen as responsible for soaring levels of pollution?</p>

        <p>When you think about the composition of ESG funds it’s first of all important to remember they are still
          meant to be a fund invested to get a return for the portfolio and so they can tilt based on industry groups,
          based on sector views and that may or may not relate to an ESG view. Ultimately, ESG funds, like all other
          investments, are meant to generate profits. In fact, ESG funds have slightly outperformed other funds over the
          last two years, at least in part thanks to their holding of tech stocks which have rallied strongly.</p>

        <p>Since 2010, the fourth-largest ESG fund in the world has increased its exposure to tech giants from about 8%
          to more than 17% within a decade. Online retail giant Amazon was one of these big tech firms seen as
          ESG-friendly, even though the company registered a carbon footprint of over 50 million metric tons of CO2 in
          2019. And with emissions rising by 15% compared to the previous year, the environmental concerns aren’t going
          away. In the case of Amazon, its commitment to reduce its carbon emissions and become carbon neutral by 2040
          is seen by some asset managers as a reason why the stock meets the definition of being ESG-friendly.   Another criticism leveled at ESG investing: it often lacks transparency.</p>

     

        <p>Organizations such as the United Nations and the European Commission are promoting common standards to
          address these concerns. At the moment, some feel there’s not enough disclosure from fund managers about why
          their products should be considered ESG-friendly. Investors may also need to do some more background work to
          ensure they’re putting their money in funds that meet their ethical objectives. And this is where further
          regulation could add some more clarity.</p>
