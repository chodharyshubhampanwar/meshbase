        <br>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The global real estate industry has undergone a tectonic shift in the last decade. India’s real estate
          industry, too, is experiencing the effects of this global disruption. As per the BEF January 2019 report, by
          2030, the real estate sector in India is expected to have a market value of USD 1 trillion. And, it will
          contribute to 13per cent of the country’s total GDP by 2025.


        <p>
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Lack of attracting tech talent, dedicated tech team, huge IT Infrastructure cost, significant duration of
            the project lifecycle, and payment realization time.</li>
          <li>
            Project finance servicing cost, continuous depletion of margins, increased cost of acquiring a customer,
            and extended transaction timeline. </li>
          <li>The convenience of buying or selling homes online is still missing. Current solutions only offer limited
          information on projects online.</li>
          <li>The COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to prolonged lockdown, has restricted customer movement to project
          sites, thus, delaying home buying. Hence, new ways India’s real estate sector opportunity - $1 Tn by 2030, 13%
          to India’s GDP by 2025. 2 have to be adopted to engage customers in going forward.</li>
          <li>Poorly managed data which is collected on real estate is still not optimized and lacks Insightful outcomes,
          that can be used to create useful models.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3>Trends </h3> Real estate players have started to rely heavily on new technologies like artificial
        intelligence, IoT, blockchain and virtual reality. Virtual tour of properties, for instance, is a major
        technology trend that saves one the hassle of dealing with pesky customers. AI-based chatbots have enabled real
        estate companies to offer round-the-clock assistance to customers. Smart-building tech is another area of
        PropTech that is causing disruptions in the real estate sector. The number of co-living space providers in the
        country has skyrocketed, Catering primarily to students and young working professionals. </p>

        <p>
        <h3>Moving forward </h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Real estate is complex - The rules change in every country (Even within a country, land is a state subject,
            so no homogeneity even within a country), so difficult to build a scalable business.</li>
            <li>  It’s an industry which has not adopted technology quickly, so scaling any business is a challenge</li>
              <li>It’s a high-value transaction, so
                customers demand extra attention from businesses, making it unscalable (Although profitable on a unit basis)
                India’s real estate sector opportunity - $1 Tn by 2030, 13% to India’s GDP by 2025</li>
              <li>
                The industry is now a
                lot more open to adopting technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), which has the potential to improve
                many facets of the industry. AI is the ability of a machine to solve problems by learning, over time. It has the
                potential to replace many routine tasks in the real estate sector.
              </li>
              <li>The future will entail an amalgamation of
                human skills along with advanced technology that will serve as an unbeatable combination for players in the Real
                Estate sector.</li>

        <h3>Opportunities</h3>
        Indian real estate is the second-largest employer in India and contributed about 8 percent to India’s GDP in
        2017 and is expected to contribute 13 percent to India’s gross domestic product (GDP) by 2025, according to a
        report by National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO) and Asia Pacific Real Estate Association (APREA).
        India’s real estate sector opportunity - $1 Tn by 2030, 13% of India’s GDP by 2025. 4 95 percent of customers
        globally search for homes through online platforms and almost 51 percent buy homes, which they found using
        online platforms. Indian Real estate is also expected to reach $1 trillion by 2030 and become the third-largest
        globally. The Internet of Things (IoT) is set to revolutionize the real estate sector. Home automation devices
        that form an integral part of the IoT are an indispensable aspect of the efficient utilization of urban spaces.
        They use artificial intelligence coupled with sensor-based technologies to offer an array of services in
        connection with the home environment. On the other side of the proptech innovation, spectrum lies blockchain. By
        making it possible to store all building data such as repair records or floor plans in a digital, central, and
        secure place, blockchain can make it much easier for investors to do their due diligence and verify all property
        details. $5Trillion is the annual spend on real estate a year (Including rentals and sales), and $200Trillion is
        the total asset value of all real estate (Across the world).</p>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>

        <p>While all the points noted above are fair, and real estate is a very difficult domain to operate in, these
          cannot be acceptable excuses for not building an internationally scalable business. All businesses have their
          difficulties, and real estate is no different.</p>

        <p>PropTech today is shifting into a necessity in the real estate segment and is no longer a novelty factor in
          the market. The advent of India’s real estate sector opportunity - $1 Tn by 2030, 13% of India’s GDP by 2025.
          5 of technology in the realty domain has not only made things more efficient but has also increased the
          transparency in the system. As the real estate market continues on its upward swing, entrepreneurs and
          businesses who harness technology in their organizations will reap the long-term benefits post the
          consolidation of the various aspects of the PropTech sector. Nevertheless, PropTech remains a trend whose full
          potential has not been explored in the Indian markets.</p>
