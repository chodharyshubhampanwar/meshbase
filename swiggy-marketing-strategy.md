# The Marketing Genius of Swiggy
Swiggy has been doing enough savage marketing on the email newsletters for quite some time now.It went to a different level altogether an hour back with a LinkedIn post from the CFO at Swiggy and then the funny rants in comments following from the top level management!Who says traditional marketing doesn't work anymore because when you can spice it up on online media so casually!

# Partnership with Netflix
Recently, Netflix and Swiggy collaborated on a minute change in user-interface (UI) design on the Swiggy phone application. While one was waiting for their food, the Swiggy application prompted users saying "Watch a Netflix trailer while your food arrives"

# Prompt Timing
Swiggy grabbed the opportunity hard as soon as Google, Youtube, Gmail... all went down!!
Now that's what I call aggressive marketing.
Keep your mind open and let the creativity inside you bloom. Hit the iron when it is hot and grab every opportunity you see

# Swiggy has settled the debate between Traditional Vs Digital Marketing.


Neither traditional nor digital is superior to the other.
This is a world where a newspaper Ad aimed at generating sales suddenly becomes a viral social media idea that generates conversations for the brand.
The CFO becomes the influencer himself and posts a picture of the Ad which asks customers to avail the offer before their CFO notices.
The other guys from the senior management participate in the joke driving the engagement further.
Consequently, the ad ends up grabbing more eyeballs than their newspaper media budget could have afforded them.
This is the best example of using Digital + Traditional advertising to scale up the impact in the “Phygital world” we live in.

PS: If this was planned, Brilliant!!

PPS: If this was unplanned, Man, what a culture! xP
